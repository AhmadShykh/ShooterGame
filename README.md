## Overview

It's a space shooting timeline game where the player encounters various obstacles in their journey through space. Assisted by Kimberly, the player receives guidance about different encounters they will face. The game is in 3D, featuring immersive post-processing effects. Unfortunately, due to delays and version changes, the terrain had to be removed to resolve errors. I made a lot of errors while creating this game. It helped me learn a lot like optimization of games when using shaders, error handling, level creation. And I hope to further polish my skills learning from these error.

## Features

- Intense space shooting action
